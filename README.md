ROpenSearch is a lightweight, Rust-native search engine with OpenSearch-compatible REST APIs. Built for teams that want the familiar OpenSearch interface with the performance and safety of Rust.

## Highlights

- **OpenSearch-compatible REST API** — drop-in `PUT /{index}`, `POST /_doc`, `GET /_search` endpoints
- **Raft consensus** — cluster state managed by [openraft](https://github.com/datafuselabs/openraft); quorum-based leader election, linearizable writes, automatic failover, persistent log storage via [redb](https://github.com/cberner/redb)
- **Distributed clustering** — multi-node clusters with shard-based data distribution
- **Synchronous replication** — primary-replica replication over gRPC; writes acknowledged only after all in-sync replicas confirm
- **Scatter-gather search** — queries fan out across shards, results merged and returned
- **Crash recovery** — binary write-ahead log (WAL) with fsync-on-write durability
- **Zero external dependencies** — no JVM, no Zookeeper, just a single binary

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (2024 edition)
- Protobuf compiler (`protoc`)

### Single node

```bash
cargo run
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t ropensearch .
docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 ropensearch
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200/
```
```json
{"name": "ropensearch-node", "version": "0.1.0", "engine": "tantivy"}
```

### Multi-node cluster

```bash
# Terminal 1
./dev_cluster.sh 1    # HTTP 9200 · Transport 9300 · Raft ID 1

# Terminal 2
./dev_cluster.sh 2    # HTTP 9201 · Transport 9301 · Raft ID 2

# Terminal 3
./dev_cluster.sh 3    # HTTP 9202 · Transport 9302 · Raft ID 3
```
### Configuration

Configure via `config/ropensearch.yml` or `ROPENSEARCH_*` environment variables:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `node_name` | `node-1` | Node identifier |

| `raft_node_id` | `1` | Unique Raft consensus node ID |

## API Reference

### Indices

```bash
# Create an index
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:9200/my-index' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"settings": {"number_of_shards": 1, "number_of_replicas": 1}}'

# Delete an index
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:9200/my-index'
```

```bash
# Index a document
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9200/my-index/_doc' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title": "Hello World", "tags": "rust search"}'

# Get a document
curl 'http://localhost:9200/my-index/_doc/{id}'

# Delete a document
curl -X DELETE 'http://localhost:9200/my-index/_doc/{id}'

# Bulk index

  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '[
    {"_doc_id": "doc-1", "_source": {"name": "Alice"}},
    {"_doc_id": "doc-2", "_source": {"name": "Bob"}}
  ]'
```

### Search

```bash
# Match all
curl 'http://localhost:9200/my-index/_search'

# Query string
curl 'http://localhost:9200/my-index/_search?q=rust'

# DSL query
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9200/my-index/_search' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query": {"match_all": {}}}'
```

### Operations

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9200/my-index/_refresh'   # Make recent writes searchable
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:9200/my-index/_flush'      # Fsync translog to disk
```

### Monitoring

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health'    # Cluster health
curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/state'     # Cluster state (nodes, indices, master)
curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/nodes'         # List nodes
curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/master'        # Current master node
curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards'        # List shards
curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices'       # List indices
```

## Consensus & Replication

ROpenSearch uses two complementary replication mechanisms:

### Cluster state (Raft consensus)
All cluster metadata — node membership, index definitions, shard assignments, master identity — is managed by Raft:

1. Mutations are proposed to the Raft leader via `client_write(ClusterCommand)`
2. Leader replicates the log entry to a majority of voters
3. Once committed, every node's state machine applies the change identically
4. Leader election happens automatically if the current leader dies (1.5–3s timeout)
5. Dead nodes are detected after 15s of missed heartbeats and removed from the cluster

### Document data (gRPC replication)
Document writes use direct primary-to-replica replication:

1. Client writes to the primary shard
2. Primary persists to its engine and WAL
3. Primary forwards the operation to all in-sync replicas via gRPC
4. Write is acknowledged only after all replicas confirm
5. Replica shards are lazily initialized on first replication request

## Testing

```bash
cargo test                                      # All 164 tests
cargo test --lib                                # Unit tests (138)
cargo test --test consensus_integration          # Raft consensus tests (15)
cargo test --test replication_integration        # Replication tests (11)
```

Integration tests run entirely in-process — they spin up real gRPC servers with isolated temp directories. No external services needed.
